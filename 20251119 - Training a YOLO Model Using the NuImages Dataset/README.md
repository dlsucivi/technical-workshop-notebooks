# Training a YOLO model using the NuImages dataset
## ABSTRACT
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection framework known for its balance of speed and accuracy. Instead of separating tasks, it performs object localization and classification simultaneously within a single neural network, enabling it to detect multiple objects in an image in just one forward pass. This workshop will provide a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess the NuImages and train them using a YOLO model.


## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Introduction to the Model and Dataset
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Training the model
4. Looking at its detections/results

## Prerequisite knowledge
Attendees should be knowledgeable about these topics:
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Have an understanding of CNN architectures
- Has experience working with PyTorch

## Dependencies
Dependencies needed for the Jupyter notebook:
- Python >= 3.9
- Pytorch (CUDA Version Recommended)
- Ultralytics YOLO
- OpenCV
- PyYAML
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Matthew Ryan Carandang is an undergraduate student at De La Salle University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science as part of the honors program BSMSCS. Currently, he is conducting his thesis research on single-stage object detection, specifically developing a module to enhance a model's performance for vehicle detection.
