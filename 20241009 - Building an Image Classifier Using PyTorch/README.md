# Building an Image Classifier Using PyTorch
## ABSTRACT
In this talk, Joseph will give an overview of the PyTorch machine learning framework and how to build a simple model for image classification. He will discuss the process for preparing the dataset, importing pre-trained models, and setting up the overall training and testing loop.

## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Preparing the PyTorch Environment.
2. Preparing the Dataset.
3. Loading Pre-Trained PyTorch Models.
4. Loss Functions and Optimizers
5. Train/Test Loops.

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Joseph Thomas M. AÃ±o is a 5th-year student from the College of Computer Studies of De La Salle University (DLSU). He is part of the BS-MS program and a member of the Center for Computational Imaging and Visual Innovations (CIVI). He is currently working on his thesis involving the design of an image classification model for the accurate classification of skin lesions.
