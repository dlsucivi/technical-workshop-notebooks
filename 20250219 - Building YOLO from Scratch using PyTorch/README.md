# Building YOLO from Scratch using PyTorch
## ABSTRACT
You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a real-time object detection model that revolutionized the field for its speed and accuracy. It processes an image at once by combining localization and classification in a single network which allows detection of objects in one forward pass. This workshop provides a step-by-step guide on the implementation of YOLOv1 in PyTorch from scratch. This workshop will also teach participants how to set up the model for training and testing, as well as visualizing its results.

## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Going over the YOLO architecture in code
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Training the model
4. Evaluating the model
5. Looking at its detections/results

## Prerequisite knowledge
Attendees should be knowledgeable about these topics:
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Knows object detection terminologies
- Have an understanding of CNN architectures
- Has experience working with PyTorch

## Dependencies
Dependencies needed for the Jupyter notebook:
- Python
- Pytorch (CUDA Version Recommended)
- Torchvision
- Torchaudio

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Juan Carlo C. Azarcon is an undergraduate student at De La Salle University (DLSU), pursuing a degree in Computer Science as part of the honors program BSMSCS. Currently, he is conducting his thesis research on object detection of aphids, focusing on integrating a filtering component in detections based on the aphids' properties to enhance accuracy and performance.
