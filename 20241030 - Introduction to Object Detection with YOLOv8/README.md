# Introduction to Object Detection with YOLOv8
## ABSTRACT
The workshop provides a brief introduction to object detection and the YOLO family leading to the development of YOLOv8. Attendees will also learn how to set up, train, and evaluate YOLOv8 from scratch. Additionally, the session will cover techniques for tuning the model to optimize its performance for various applications.

## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. A brief introduction to object detection and YOLOv8
2. Setting up of environment dependencies and libraries
3. Loading of a pre-trained model and demo
4. Training YOLOv8 from scratch including some hyperparameter tuning
5. Evaluating the model

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Juan Carlo C. Azarcon is an undergraduate student at De La Salle University (DLSU), pursuing a degree in Computer Science as part of the honors program BSMSCS. Currently, he is conducting his thesis research on object detection of aphids, focusing on integrating a filtering component in detections based on the aphids' properties to enhance accuracy and performance.
