# Hands-on Pruning of Computer Vision Models in PyTorch
## ABSTRACT
Pruning is one of the most practical techniques for reducing the size and computational cost of deep learning models while preserving accuracy. This workshop gives participants hands-on experience with pruning in PyTorch. Using a small CNN trained on a lightweight dataset, attendees will learn how to apply unstructured and structured pruning, retrain the pruned model, and measure performance trade-offs.


## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Training a baseline CNN
2. Applying unstructured pruning in PyTorch
3. Applying structured pruning in PyTorch
4. Fine-tuning and retraining the pruned model
5. Evaluating trade-offs

## Prerequisite knowledge
Attendees should be knowledgeable about these topics:
- Familiarity with CNNs
- Basic experience working with PyTorch

## Dependencies
Dependencies needed for the Jupyter notebook:
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch (CUDA version recommended)
- Torchvision
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Rafael Subo A. Yap is currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at De La Salle University (DLSU) under the BSMSCS Honors program. He is a tutor with the Peer Tutors Society (PTS) and a member of the Center for Computational Imaging & Visual Innovations (CIVI). His current research focuses on the optimization of deep learning models for counting small objects, with a particular interest in mosquito egg detection as a tool for vector surveillance and public health.
