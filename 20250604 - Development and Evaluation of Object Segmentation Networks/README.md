# Development and Evaluation of Object Segmentation Networks

## ABSTRACT

This hands-on workshop offers participants a comprehensive introduction to object segmentation, which is an essential technique in computer vision for precisely identifying and delineating objects within images. Designed for beginners to intermediate learners, the session walks through the end-to-end workflow of developing and evaluating object segmentation models. Attendees will be guided through the practical steps of setting up and training object segmentation models, followed by evaluation procedures using standard metrics. The session concludes with an analysis of model performance through quantitative metrics, helping participants interpret detection results and refine their models effectively. By the end of the workshop, participants will have built a functional object segmentation pipeline and gained the confidence to apply these techniques to their own projects.

## The outline of the workshop is as follows:

1. Introduction to Object Segmentation
2. Dataset Preparation (Preprocessing + Modelling)
3. Environment Preparation
4. Review of Architecture behind Object Segmentation Models used in the Workshop
5. Setting up the Models
6. Training the Models
7. Evaluating the Models
8. Observing Model detection metrics and results
