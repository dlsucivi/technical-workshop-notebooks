# Implementing Decoupling for FGVC Tasks with Noisy Labels
## ABSTRACT
Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves classifying subjects with large similarities and small, subtle differences in appearance. FGVC differs from most image classification tasks as it requires expertise to distinguish between two subjects that look very similar according to the average person with little to no experience in the domain. Despite advances in deep learning, creating large datasets with accurate annotations makes this a more challenging classification task. This workshop tackles on the implementation of decoupling in the Jupyter Notebook following the previous lecture.

## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Build the model
1a. Preprocessing/data cleaning (e.g. check for corrupted images)
1b. Set up CNNs
1c. Run the model
2. Review results and compare and contrast with base model
3. Summarize steps done in building the model
4. Hands-on
5. Create your own model using different CNNs.

## Prerequisite knowledge
Attendees should be knowledgeable about these topics:
- Know the basics of machine learning.
- Must have experience using Python.
- Experience implementing a classifier model in Python is required.

## Dependencies
Dependencies needed for the Jupyter notebook:
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pillow
- Path
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Tqdm
- Scikit-learn
- Fastai
- Opencv-python

## ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Kate Justine U. Ermita√±o is a fourth year student at De La Salle University, pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Computer Science. As a member of the Center for Computational Imaging and Visual Innovations (CIVI) and Science Education Institute - Department of Science and Technology (DOST-SEI) merit scholar, their area of research centers around Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC). Furthermore, they are also interested in areas such as object detection and data science. They served their sophomore and junior years partaking in the role of a tutor at the Peer Tutors Society (PTS), specializing in discrete structures, algorithms and complexities, and mathematics. They also worked as a technical writer at the Technology, Education, Entertainment, Empathy Design (TE3D) House for their internship as a junior.
