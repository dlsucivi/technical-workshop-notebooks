# Development of Camouflaged Object Detection Networks
## ABSTRACT
This hands-on workshop offers participants a comprehensive introduction to Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), a field in computer vision that focuses on segmenting hard-to-spot images in environments. Designed for advanced learners, the session walks through the end-to-end workflow of developing and evaluating COD models. Attendees will be guided through the practical steps of setting up and training COD models, followed by evaluation procedures using standard metrics. The session concludes with an analysis of model performance through quantitative metrics, helping participants interpret detection results and refine their models effectively. By the end of the workshop, participants will have built a functional COD pipeline and gained the confidence to apply these techniques to their own projects.


## The outline of the workshop is as follows:
1. Introduction to Object Segmentation
2. Dataset Preparation (Preprocessing + Modelling)
3. Environment Preparation
4. Review of Architecture behind Camouflaged Object Detection Models
5. Setting up the Models
6. Training the Models
7. Evaluating the Models
8. Observing Model Detection metrics and results
